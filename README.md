# Chessboard-with-Python

__Project : Chessboard with Python__

__Overview:__ Developed a Python program that simulates a chessboard and allows users to play a game of chess against another player or an AI opponent. The program provides a graphical representation of the chessboard and implements the rules and logic of the game, enabling players to make legal moves, capture opponent pieces, and checkmate to win the game.

__Role and Responsibilities:__ As the sole developer, I designed and implemented the chessboard logic and user interface using object-oriented programming principles. I incorporated features such as validating moves, implementing the rules of chess (including castling, en passant, and promotion), and providing an interactive user experience.

__Technologies and Tools:__ Python, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Pygame (for graphical user interface)

__Results and Impact:__ The Chessboard program offers an engaging and interactive platform for players to enjoy the game of chess. It provides a visually appealing chessboard interface, supports multiplayer mode for friendly matches, and offers AI opponents of varying difficulty levels for solo play. The program helps users enhance their chess skills, strategize, and have an enjoyable gaming experience.
